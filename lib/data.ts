The application demonstrates advanced Angular routing, RxJS reactive patterns, Angular Signals for fine-grained reactivity, computed properties for derived state management, API integration, accessibility best practices, and automated CI/CD deployment on Vercel—all while maintaining clean, refactorable code.",
